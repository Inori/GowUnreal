# GowUnreal

The project is aiming to export resources in God of War 4 at it's right position within a scene
and import them into UE5.

The exported resources will also be stored in FBX format of Autodesk, so they can be imported into Maya.

### Feature
1. The exported resources can be stored in FBX format of Autodesk, so they can be imported into Maya.
2. Provide a game patch which can unlock the limitationn of camera distance, such that we can capture more objects in a frame at any position.
3. Provide an UE5 plugin which can save GOW4 resource to uasset files and build meshes and materials in editor.
4. Manually fix objects in scene which are hard to import programmably, to make it more like the real game. (todo)
5. Implement disintegrating meshes with particles algorithm. (todo)
6. Record Kratos animation. (todo)
