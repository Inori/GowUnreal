Build Instructions:
1. Clone the repo recursively (git clone "github.com/HitmanHimself/GOWTool" --recursive)
2. Building the project requires Visual Studio 2022.
3. cmake CMakeLists.txt present in DirectXTex and GLTFSDK.
4. Build GOWTool sln/proj.

Note:
1. This tool requires 3rd party oodle dll (oo2core_7_win64.dll/oo2core_7_win32.dll), grab it from some game and paste in build dir(along with GOWTool.exe).
2. Tool is under heavy construction, you may encounter bugs.
